## Overview

Create a website to showcase my projects and to let companies know a little bit more about me.

### Goals

- Show case some of the projects I've done.
- Have the ability to contact me through my website.
- Display my resume while also being able to download my resume.
- Let companies know a little bit more about me.

### What I learned

Used a lot of css `animation`, `transform`, and `translate`. Using `useParams` and array methods to dynamically display projects from my data file. `useHistory` to navigate back to the previous page. I am most proud of my project carousel. It took me a bit to figure out the logic to get it working properly.

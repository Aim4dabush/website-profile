## Overview

Create a website to showcase my projects and to let companies know a little bit more about me.

### Goals

- Show case some of the projects I've done.
- Have the ability to contact me through my website.
- Display my resume while also being able to download my resume.
- Let companies know a little bit more about me.

### What I learned

Used a lot of css `animation`, `transform`, and `translate`. I used firebase firestore as my database to hold my project data. Firebase storage to hold my project pictures. Redux and Redux Toolkit to handle my state management. Using `useParams` to dynamically display my projects. I am most proud of my project carousel. It took me a bit to figure out the logic to get it working properly.
